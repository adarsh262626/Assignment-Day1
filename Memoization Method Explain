file name : Pasc_Tri_Memoization.java

Same as Recurvive Method but with Global HashMap for storing value  using Key,Value Pair

Key is taken as String because keys must be unique for every non-indentical value
if I sum i+j then for example : 
                                 case 1 :  2+3 = 6
                                 case 2 :  3+2 = 6
But in String 23 != 32 (Note Implicit Type Promtion (integer to String) is beiing performed by JVM)
