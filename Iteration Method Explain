Iteration Method - file Name : Pasc_Tri_Loop.java 

Using for loop with two nested loop inside outer loop 

Start

Let rows = number of rows by user
Outer loop : Loops trough 0 to rows
  for each loop (rows) : 1st Inner loop adds space for beatiful output
                       :  2nd Inner Loop Applyes formula of nCr giving respective pascal value for that position(i,j)
                            i - gives value of n
                            j - gives value of r
                                nCr formula = n!/(n-r)! * r!
  adds next line for another row to start form fresh line
